# CLAUDE.md (paper)

This folder is the `paper` branch: only the paper's files, checked out as a git worktree at `<repo>/paper/`. Commit paper
edits here; code goes to `dev` in the parent folder. Branch, repository, and artifact rules: [INIT.md](INIT.md).

## Format

- Follow the venue's template strictly. IEEE: `\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}`, no compsoc, no changes to
  spacing, fonts, or captions (desk-reject risk), so no `caption` package and no custom widths (`\IEEEsetlabelwidth`).
- Everything up to Data Availability fits the page limit; references take their own pages.
- No `\usepackage` that the paper does not use. In the final version, clean up every `\newcommand`/`\renewcommand`
  (write the definition out in the text and delete it); while drafting, the tool name may go through `\tool{}`.
- Unknown numbers stay as red `\TODO{...}`.

## Writing

- Each section follows `guidelines/section/<section>.md`: `skeleton.md` gives the structure, the word proportions, and
  §7 (common rules); `floats.md` covers figures and tables.
- Final review: give review agents only the PDF and `guidelines/review_prompt.md` (the user's own review prompt, used
  verbatim); the procedure (venue criteria, calibration with accepted papers) is in `guidelines/review.md`.
- Draft layout: every paragraph is exactly two lines in `main.tex`: the Korean paragraph on one line, commented out
  with `%`, directly above the English paragraph on one line; a blank line between paragraphs, no line breaks inside a
  paragraph. Floats, math, captions, abbreviations, and key terms stay English.
  `python3 paper/src/to_english.py paper/main.tex > main.en.tex` drops the Korean for submission.
- Workflow: answer in Korean. Revise paragraph by paragraph: show the Korean version first, and once it is confirmed,
  show the English version (then proofread). Propose other changes in Korean first and apply them after approval. For a
  results subsection, review the paragraph flow before the paragraphs.
  Plans list tasks only, never schedules or deadline judgments.
- Style (details in `skeleton.md` §7):
  - Results go float, then numbers per metric, then the conclusion last; no headline sentence.
  - Comparisons are relative "% more/less", one form per metric; no forced statistical tests; no "much/far".
  - Percentages without "N of M" in the Abstract and Introduction.
  - Leave out weaknesses and details the message does not need (the artifact has them); keep the strongest claim the
    data support.
  - One term per concept; abbreviations as "Automated Program Repair (APR)" at their first use in each section; tool
    names cited, not expanded.
  - Tool names, ours and prior work's, in `\textsc{}` everywhere, including table headers and figure labels (all-caps
    names capitalized inside: `\textsc{Clara}`). Metrics and newly defined terms in `\emph{}` where they are defined.
  - Baselines are not named in the Abstract or Introduction; comparisons there say "three state-of-the-art techniques"
    with citations and give results as ranges. The Conclusion repeats the Abstract's claims without numbers.
- Figures: mix graphs into the results (tables only for exact per-item values); floats `[h]`, above their first mention.

## Data and build

- All code for the paper's analyses, tables, and figures lives in `src/` here (or in one `paper.ipynb`), never in `dev`,
  and writes its results to `output/` here. `python paper/src/summarize.py` reads `../output/` and writes
  `output/tables.tex` and `output/numbers.txt`; `python3 paper/src/fill_tables.py` copies the `% rows:<name>` sections
  into the `% rows:<name>` ... `% end rows` blocks of `main.tex`.
- `main.tex` never `\input`s a generated `.tex`: table and plot data are written into `main.tex` itself. The only files
  `main.tex` may reference in `output/` are images (`.png` etc., via `\includegraphics`).
- Build in a scratch copy: `pdflatex → bibtex → pdflatex ×2`, then check `main.log` for `^!|undefined`.
- `references.bib`: the user copies each entry from Google Scholar by hand. Never rewrite those entries; when asked,
  only prune entries that `main.aux` does not cite, and report bibliography issues for the user to fix.
- PDFs (`main.pdf`, `guidelines/*.pdf`) stay local (`.gitignore`).

## This project (ZPDPatch)

- Target: ICSE-SEET 2027 Research Paper (criteria: Relevance, Significance, Soundness, Verifiability, Presentation;
  novelty is not one). No user study was run: claim no educational or confirmatory benefit.
- The tool name is written as `\textsc{ZPDPatch}`; its stages are Mine, Train, Select, with the same words and order in
  the Abstract, Introduction, Overview, and Conclusion. Algorithms' Input/Output lines use `\item[\textbf{Input:}]`.
- RQ1 runs on the 14-problem benchmark (CodeNet Python800 submissions, FixEval tests) shared with a concurrent
  submission from the same group: describe its construction directly and do not cite that work while it is under review.
  Keep this paper visibly distinct from that one: classify prior work by what it steers the repair toward
  (reference-driven, model-driven, solution-space hints; ours is trajectory-supervised), not by how it locates the fault;
  write every sentence fresh; and lead with what differs (steps learned from trajectories; deployment reads only the
  current submission). RQ1 baselines are MENTORED (reference-driven) and LSGen with GPT-4o (model-driven), from their
  stored upstream runs re-judged by our runner; their resource budget stays out of the paper (artifact README only).
  RQ2-RQ4 keep the canonical CodeNet Seen/Unseen and CodeWorkout Java data.
- The goal is framed by the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD): a patch within the region a student reaches with help,
  approximated from execution evidence in student trajectories; the judge's verdict is the help before the next
  submission. Never claim a measured learning effect.
- Reviews: every review is done by a newly spawned agent with no conversation history, given only the latest PDF and
  `guidelines/review_prompt.md`; never reuse a reviewer or let the editing agent review its own work. Ask for the review
  in Korean, keep it verbatim in `notes/reviews/`, and never steer it toward a score. Calibrate with recent accepted
  ICSE-SEET papers as `guidelines/review.md` describes.
- `notes/`: reviews, rewrite records, literature audits, and the earlier submission's verification records.
